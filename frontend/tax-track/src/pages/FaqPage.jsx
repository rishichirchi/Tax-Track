              The salary income is comprised of the Basic salary + HRA + Special Allowance + Transport Allowance + any other allowance. Some of the components of the salary are exempt from tax, like reimbursement of the telephone bills, leave travel allowance, etc. If you have rented a place and received HRA, you can also claim an exemption on HRA.

              Apart from these deductions, there is a standard deduction of Rs 40,000 which was introduced in the budget 2018 which was later increased to Rs 50,000 in the budget 2019.

              No, if your income is below the basic exemption limit then you are not required to file income tax returns. However, those with an income less than Rs 2.5L and who still want to claim an income tax refund can only claim the refund by filing an ITR. Otherwise, if itâ€™s above the basic exemption limit, it is mandatory to file income tax returns.
